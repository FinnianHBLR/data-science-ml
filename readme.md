## Main points
There is **6.6** minutes to showcase what we have.

That is 2-3 minutes for each slide. You should have 3-4 for team memeber for a total of 20 minutes.

* Team 
    * Arran 
    * Finnian
    * Aly

* We are a consulting company. 
* Our target audience is the CEO and CTO. What's important for them?

* Core points
    * Timing 
    * Completnes of results
    * Reflection
        * What value can we derive
        * Why was the analysis done in this particular way?
        * Is the presentation easy to comprened

## Our advising scenario (Taxi)  
We're going to go with:
* Statement, Explantaion, example, elaboration, meaning for target.

Two questions from T1 and T2.  
* 1. **T1** How much do taxis earn per trip if they can
only drive 30km or 50km per trip, compared
to taxis that have no limit? (i.e. what is the
average income from trips <30km or <50km
compared to the total revenue?)
* 2. **T2** Find out if more taxi rides are starting in the
north or south

One question T3-T8.
* 3. **T7** Find out if and how the tip depends on the
trip distance. (Histogram?)  

One we can choose
* 4. Where are higher tips?

Questions you should consider!
* Which E-taxi type should be used? One that needs a
battery recharding every 30km and cost 20.000 or one
that needs a recharging every 50km and costs 30.000
EUR?  
* Will limiting to short range trips have an impact on
the tips?  
* Are there favourable times and locations to wait for
customers (considering the limit to short trips)
* What are other uses of our data (possibly for a traffic
information service)?
